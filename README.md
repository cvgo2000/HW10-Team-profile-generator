## Description

For this homework, we were tasked to build a team generator command line application for a software engineering team.

The application must also pass all unit tests for components.

## Installation

Clone included files to your local repository then use the command line "npm i" to install all file dependencies locally.

## Usage

A command line based application for team managers to create a team profile via prompted basic information.
